# Final Project 

The online data set is the Life Expectancy (WHO), which consists of data from 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries. World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of all countries' health status and many other related factors. The dataset is made available to the public for health data analysis. The dataset related to life expectancy, and health factors for 193 countries during 2000-2015, consists of 22 columns and 2938 rows, that have been collected from the same WHO data repository website.

This page goes further into factors and variables that play a role in “Developing” and “Developed” counties' life expectancy. Futhermore, as the datasets were from WHO, we found no evident errors. Missing data were handled by filling null values with the means. The result indicated that most of the missing data were for population, Hepatitis B, and GDP.

Note: 
- Final Project-code.py was added instead of the Jupytor notebook file, as it was too big to be uploaded onto the Github page
